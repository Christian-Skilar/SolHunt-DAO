        <p>
            Not free anymore? 
            The truth is, no one wants to work for free. and to be able 
            to have the callers we have, get new callers as we grow, and keep them, we 
            need to pay them. The price is not set for us to profit 
            from, it will be distributed to the callers, team, bots for 
            the discord, and the rest will go to our community wallet. 
            From this wallet we can buy NFTs to raffle out, money 
            giveaways and what ever we want as a community. 
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            We have several plans for you to choose from, and we use
            Discord payment bot for the service. this will give you 
            access to the full serveer with the Alpha role after you 
            have made the payment. This is not a subscription, the bot will 
            send you a dm 72 hours before your plan runs out. if you don't 
            make the next payment, you simply just lose your role.
            <br>
            <br>
            You will also get a dashboard were you can view your currant
            plan, plans that are available, and how long before it runs out
